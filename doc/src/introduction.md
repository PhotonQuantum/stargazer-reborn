# Introduction

Stargazer is a flexible vtuber tracker, reborn.

It's the second attempt to rewrite [pystargazer](https://github.com/suisei-cn/pystargazer) in Rust. The first attempt is
[stargazer-rs](https://github.com/suisei-cn/stargazer-rs), of which the development has been stalled for a while.

This new version attempts to utilize a more modern microservice architecture, and is meant to be stable and simple to
develop and deploy.

## Architecture

**Note**: this is subject to change during development process. For up-to-date graph, see [arch.drawio].

The system is designed to be flexible and easy to extend, which composed of multiple modules. Include:

- A centralized MongoDB as shared data source
- A coordinator to distribute tasks
- A worker pool to execute tasks
- A message queue to collect and dispatch messages generated by workers
- Multiple middlewares to provide extra functionality
- Multiple clients(bots) to send the message to subscribers
- A Web UI for users to manage their subscribe preference
- An API to manage the system and provide functionality to frontend and bots
