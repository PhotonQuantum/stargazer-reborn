# Stargazer

Stargazer is a flexible vtuber tracker, reborn.

It's the second attempt to rewrite [pystargazer](https://github.com/suisei-cn/pystargazer). The first attempt is
[stargazer-rs](https://github.com/suisei-cn/stargazer-rs), of which the development has been stalled for a while.

This new version attempts to utilize a more modern microservice architecture, and is meant to be stable and simple to
develop and deploy.
